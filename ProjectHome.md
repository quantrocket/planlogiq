# Welcome to planlogIQ #

planlogIQ is a fully webbased corporate planning solution, itÂ´s completely written in PHP based upon the PRADO-Framework - www.pradosoft.com

The official website can be found under:

http://www.planlogiq.com

For all interested users, we setup a new manual wiki (sorry, currently only in german), where you will find a lot of information related to the application,

You need an SQL-Database backend, to run the application. We develop on MySQL.

It includes the concepts of ROLAP and OLCAP.

We currently want to establish a dual license system, so that non-profit organisations can use the software for free! Profit Organisations should pay a small fee for further development, and if consulting is required, they'll get an individual offer.
